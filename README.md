Horses and Divorces is a wiki-based guessing game about judgment, surprise, and our own pop culture blind spots. It pulls data from Wikipediaâ€™s API to showcase public figures from the 20th and 21st centuries (and their spouses) inviting players to guess which figure had more marriages. Beyond the trivia, it opens space to reflect on what our casual conversations about celebrity lives reveal about us. More importantly, it's silly and fun.
